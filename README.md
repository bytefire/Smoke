This automated betting framework is intended to allow you to add:

1. betting odds providers (e.g. Betfair)
2. betting data providers (e.g. ScoresPro)
3. automated betting strategies

This contains two sample betting strategies named Genghis (and its improved version Genghis II) and Tamerlane. 

The solution builds successfully in Visual Studio 2012 using .NET 4.5. To run it set any of the sample strategies project as startup. That will require a valid Betfair username and password.

Do play around, hope it helps you. If you have any questions or you are interested in contributing, do let me know.
